This blog post ist about my first steps of using tilt. I will show a small example simular to the Getting started example on the tilt website. [Getting started](https://docs.tilt.dev/)
If you want to follow along with what i am writing about you need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/), [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) and of course [tilt](https://docs.tilt.dev/install.html)
